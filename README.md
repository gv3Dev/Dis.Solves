<h3>Please read everything below before installation & use of EdgyBot 🔻</h3>
<p>This is a work in progress. It gets better with every update and is built on bug reports. Please send us any bugs or issues you have so we can EdgyBot better 😊</p>

<h3>Tool Description:</h3>
<p>EdgyBot: A partially AFK Edgenuity Bot brought to you by EdgePlus+. Works on many activities offered by Edgenuity. The bot's main purpose is to progress a user through the course time line while they do other non Edgenuity related tasks. It does all non graded activities (By itself) & for the graded activities, it unlocks brainly and auto searches. It also has an auto answer function for quizzes and tests.</p>

<h3>Common Problems: </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). </li><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. 🔄</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. 🤷‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer  (unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store). 👎</li><br>
</ul>
